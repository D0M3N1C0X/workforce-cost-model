"""
Office files are zip archives stamped with the time they were written, so the same workbook
built twice differs byte for byte. Rewriting every entry with a fixed timestamp, and pinning
the created/modified dates inside docProps/core.xml, makes the content reproducible.

Compressed bytes can still differ between zlib builds, so CI compares the decompressed
entries (``same_content``) rather than the files themselves.
